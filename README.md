## Introduction
Welcome to my SQuAD Question Answering project! This repository explores the utilization of advanced Transformer models for enhancing the task of question answering, specifically focusing on improving contextual understanding. The project aims to leverage state-of-the-art NLP techniques to provide accurate and insightful answers to a wide array of questions.

## Project Structure
The project's directory structure is organized as follows:

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

## Features
- **Advanced Models:** Leverage the power of Transformer-based architectures for accurate contextual understanding.
- **Data Processing:** Utilize data preprocessing scripts to efficiently prepare the SQuAD dataset for training.
- **Training and Evaluation:** Train your model with ease and evaluate its performance using common QA metrics.
- **Experimentation:** Use the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for interactive experimentation.

## Models
The project explores several cutting-edge Transformer models, including BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT. These models have been fine-tuned on the SQuAD dataset to excel in question answering tasks.

## Evaluation
Evaluate your trained models using metrics like Exact Match (EM) and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into how accurately your model is able to generate answers that match the ground truth.
